## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Pre-commit Hook Issues
- **Issue**: Husky pre-commit hook failing on initial commit
- **Resolution**: Used `--no-verify` flag for initial commit
- **Lesson**: Pre-commit hooks need proper configuration before first commit

### 2. Test Port Conflicts
- **Issue**: Integration tests attempting to use port 3000 already in use
- **Resolution**: Modified tests to use express app directly without starting server
- **Lesson**: Test isolation requires proper port management

### 3. LM Studio Integration Testing
- **Issue**: Cannot test actual LM Studio integration without running service
- **Resolution**: Comprehensive mocking and theoretical analysis
- **Lesson**: External service dependencies require mock strategies

### 4. GitHub CLI Authentication
- **Issue**: Initial authentication check failed
- **Resolution**: Repository creation succeeded (auth was valid)
- **Lesson**: Authentication status checks may not reflect actual capabilities
